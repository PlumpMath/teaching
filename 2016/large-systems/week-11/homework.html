<h3 id="c--c">µC → µC</h3>
<p>Try and get two Arduinos to communicated using <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Wire">I2C</a>, <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Serial">Serial</a>, or some other protocol. Once you have that working, design and implement a protocol of your own for the Arduinos to communicate with. Is there any reason to use something if your own design? How does it compare with I2C or Serial?</p>

<h3 id="final-project">Final Project</h3>

<p>Your final project is to design and implement a system that meets the definition of a Large System we have been using: a system where code running in more than one place must coordinate. I <em>strongly</em> encourage overlapping this project with projects in other classes if possible.</p>

<p>Send me your proposal if you have not already. In addition to a proposal, prepare a <em>network diagram</em> of the kind I have been drawing in class. You do not have to be very formal about it, but make sure to include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Every node in your system
    <ul>
      <li>What kind of machine is it? Is it a laptop? An arduino? Is there anything particular about it?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Arrows between nodes to indicateo the flow of information
    <ul>
      <li>What direction is the information flowing?</li>
      <li>What protocol is being used?</li>
      <li>How is the data formatted?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
