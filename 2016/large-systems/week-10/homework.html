<h3 id="deployed-code">Deployed code</h3>

<p>Get into groups. Each group should make and deploy at least <em>two</em> apps to the cloud, and they should <em>interact</em> with one another. So, if a group makes two apps A and B, and I visit the public URL of app A, it should interact with B somehow, either by reading data from it, or updating it. You can use DynamoDB is you need a database, or any other cloud service integration. I have written up <a href="../../services">a bunch of them for you</a>, so pick the ones that make the most sense for your project.</p>

<h3 id="final-project">Final Project</h3>

<p>Your final project is to design and implement a system that meets the definition of a Large System we have been using: a system where code running in more than one place must coordinate. I <em>strongly</em> encourage overlapping this project with projects in other classes if possible.</p>

<h3 id="hardware">Hardware</h3>

<p>We will be starting the hardware part of the class next week, so bring an Arduino and a breadboard.</p>
