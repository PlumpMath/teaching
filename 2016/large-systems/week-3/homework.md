Use one or more web APIs to drive a visual and/or interactive sketch. The contents of the sketch are up to you, but make sure to make meaningful use of at least one web API.

You are free to use any programming language and any API, but the most straightforward approach is to use [Processing](https://processing.org/) and an API that produces JSON or XML. Use the [code](https://gist.github.com/nasser/dc6c9b25628426acfe32) from class to build off of if you like.

### Useful Processing reference

* [`loadJSONObject`](https://processing.org/reference/loadJSONObject_.html) loads a [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) object from a file or the web
* [`loadJSONArray`](https://processing.org/reference/loadJSONArray_.html) loads a [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) array from a file or the web
* [`loadXML`](https://processing.org/reference/loadXML_.html) loads an [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) document a file or the web
* [`loadTable`](https://processing.org/reference/loadTable_.html) loads a [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) document a file or the web
* [`XML`](https://processing.org/reference/XML.html) the type of object that is returned by `loadXML`
* [`Table`](https://processing.org/reference/Table.html) the type of object that is returned by `loadTable`
* [`JSONObject`](https://processing.org/reference/JSONObject.html) the type of object that is returned by `loadJSONObject`
* [`JSONArray`](https://processing.org/reference/JSONArray.html) the type of object that is returned by `loadJSONArray`

### Submission
