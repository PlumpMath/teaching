**Due** 1 Mar 2016

In the same pairs as last week, port your OSC sketches to work over TCP sockets. Pay attention to how your code is different now, and how it's the same. What do you have to worry about that you didn't before? What do you have more control over?

You are free to use any programming language, but the most straightforward approach is to use [Processing](https://processing.org/) and the built-in [networking](https://processing.org/reference/libraries/net/index.html) library. 

### Network Essay

Alexander R. Galloway wrote an [elaborate essay](https://processing.org/tutorials/network/) on the Processing site covering basic networking topics and providing examples in the networking library towards the end. This is a good jumping off point.

### Submission

Email me your code as an attachment or a link before Tuesday to get feedback on it. Come to class prepared to present your work, discuss your expeirence, the problems you faced, how you overcame them.
