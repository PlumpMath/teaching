**Due** 18 Oct 2016

1. Pick two prototypes from the punch lists you made to build in Unity without using any code
2. You can use any built-in Unity components or free assets on the asset store to make your prototype

Keep in mind:

* Your game is made out of GameObjects
* GameObjects are containers for Components
* Components contain **state** (data)
* Components react to **events** (behavior)
* Components are either built in or 
* You make games in Unity by mixing and matching Components on GameObjects
