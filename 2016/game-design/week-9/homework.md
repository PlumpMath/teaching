**Due** 15 Nov 2016

1. Make prototype using the physics engine. Try and make an entire game that uses nothing but triggers and collisions.
2. Propose a final project. You may work in groups, and you may combine this project with one in another class. As I said in class, I will expect documentation of the full process at the end of the semester. The more brainstorming, planning, and iterating you do the better. Don't hold back.
3. Start thinking of the special topics within Unity that your final projects will need and we will make time to explore them in class together.

Take care of yourselves.
