**Due** 8 Nov 2016

1. Make art using [Blender](http://blender.org/), [SketchUp](http://www.sketchup.com/), or any other package you want.
2. Make a prototype in Unity using the art you made and the linear algebra we looked at in class. A game about moving or steering things would be great.
3. Start thinking about your final projects. The only constraint is that you develop it in Unity and C#, and that you iterate on it and generate prototypes. The more prototypes you can show the better.
