**Due** 6 Dec 2016

Same as last week:

1. Keep working on your final projects! 
2. Try and go through as many iterations as possible this week, at least one. (Remember that the number of iterations you go through is the most important thing)
3. This will involve *finding people to playtest your game*. This can be friends, classmates, or anyone else.
4. NYU holds playtests Thursday evenings and you can get involved in that. Get to MAGNET at 5pm on Thursday to set up and playtest your game.
5. Be prepared to talk about this experience and your progress in class.
