**Due** 22 Nov 2016

1. Start work on your final projects. You're expected to have a playable prototype by next class.
2. The level of polish for this first prototype is less important than having something *playable*. How you scale down your idea into something that fits the time you have and your skillset is a big part of the exercise
3. Send me your ideas for feedback. I can point you towards other games, libraries, and parts of the Unity API that might be helpful.
4. Be prepared to talk about your whole project, your brainstorming process, and how this first prototype relates to the final product.
5. Come prepared with *questions* about your game that you want to answer by play testing. Think of this prototype as a way to figure out what works and does not work for your game.
