**Due** 29 Nov 2016

1. Keep workin on your final projects! 
2. Try and go through as many iterations as possible this week, at least one. (Remember that the number of iterations you go through is the most important thing)
3. This will involve *finding people to playtest your game*. This can be friends, classmates, or anyone else.
4. NYU holds playtests Thursday evenings and you can get involved in that. (I will post details on how to do that shortly)
5. Prepared to talk about this experience and your progress in class.
