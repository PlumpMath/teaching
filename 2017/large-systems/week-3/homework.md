**Due** 14 Feb 2016 ❤️

Using the [code from class](https://gist.github.com/nasser/ee57598a1a18043c575d39f4c833a737) as a starting point, write a p5.js sketch that consumes data from a JSON file and visualizes it/does something interesting with it.

1. Set up p5.js (reviewed in the [notes](../notes))
2. Build on the `data.json` file to use more features of JSON, including numbers, arrays, and objects
3. Build on the logic in `sketch.js` to consume this data as we did in class and visualize it

Next week we will look at web APIs, so if you have any you are interested bring them to class.
