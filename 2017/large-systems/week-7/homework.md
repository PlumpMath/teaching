## Send Me Your Pongs
Make sure to email me your Pong code!

## A Better Pong Protocol
We began discussing in class what a better protocol for networked pong might look like. Design an improvement for next week that addresses some of the conceptual problems we encountered. Try and be as detailed as you can, and come to class prepared to discuss.

## Cloud Set Up

We will be using [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com) as our cloud provider this semester. [Sign up](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/registrations/new) for an account, and we will spend next class configuring it.

DigitalOcean is not free. They will bill you for every hour your code is running. Their cheapest option is $0.007/hr, so I wouldn't expect to pay more than $5 - $10 this semester.
